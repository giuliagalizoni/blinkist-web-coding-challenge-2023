# Hello, Blinkist team ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the web coding challenge.

The page was built with Javascript, HTML and CCS. I used the [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) to properly implement the AB Test and store the information to be tracked.

## Notes

- As instructed, the information tracked by `analytics-api.js` is printed on the browser console.
- To start the app on development mode, run `npm start`
