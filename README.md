# Hello, Blinkist team üëã

This is my solution to the web coding challenge. You can see the [detailed explanation here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14OglNZN4bg7h17RggYNmcCCJY2GUhtPH/view).

The page was built with Javascript, HTML and CCS. I used the [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) to implement the AB Test and store the information to be tracked. As instructed, the information tracked by `analytics-api.js` is printed on the browser console.

### To start the app, please run and `npm start` üöÄ

Unfortunately, I couldn't make the deployment on GitHub pages work on time to deliver the task due to bundle problems. I initially tried to use [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/blinkist-web-coding-challenge-2023-forked-zi9t6n?file=/src/index.js), but the platform is having [issues with the onload event](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/issues/4683), which is an important part of the logic I used to implement the pageview tracking. I am aware it's not ideal, but I hope you can run the app locally to test and review my solution.

Thank you so much for the opportunity to show my work. I hope you enjoy it üçÄ
